    <p>In HTML 5 you can specifically mark up all the “secondary” content on a page such as navigation, branding, copyright notices, so it feels odd that you can’t specifically mark up the most important part of your page—the content.</p>
<p>
But what would be the purpose of marking it up specifically, anyway? If you need to style it, use a div. An assistive technlogy like a screenreader can find the main content because it is the first thing inside a page that isn’t a header, nav or footer.</p>
